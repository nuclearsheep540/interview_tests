A social media feed

You are tasked to write an app that reads data from A company's social media feeds, examples
below. Your app should gather information about their latest posts and output the data to a web
page.

Social media examples:

● https://www.youtube.com/

This is an open-ended brief and largely left to your own interpretation, but please take note of
the below.

Guidelines

● The web page should look something like the below wireframe

● Your app should be able to run in a self contained, local environment (i.e not relying on
any cloud services)

● Your submission must make use of a modern javascript framework (preferably React JS)

● Provide a README in your submission including:
  - Where you have utilised any additional libraries or frameworks, explain your
technology choices
  - Instructions needed to run/install your app
  - Any additional information you think is relevant

● A single social media post should contain the below:
  - Title
  - Body
  - Created date
  - Origin site indicator e.g. Twitter, YouTube.
  - Any associated media

■ You can choose to embed media in your HTML page
